# GORVEL

Golang ~~Framework~~ Boilerplate

## How to?

I should assume you've installed your go in your machine, to start working with this, you make clone it under your `$GOPATH/src/`

```bash
$> echo $GOPATH
/Users/daison/go

$> cd /Users/daison/go
$> mkdir src/
$> wget -c https://github.com/daison12006013/gorvel/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz
$> cd gorvel-master
```

Once you extracted gorvel, you may compile or run directly the `serve.go`

```bash
$> go run serve.go
```
